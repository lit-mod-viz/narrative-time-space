# Narrative Space/Time Expert Annotator Guidelines

## Goal

We would like to train a machine to discern boundaries between scenes in novels.
Here, scenes are defined as discrete units of narrative time and space. To 
provide the machine with instructive examples, we are asking a dozen or so 
human volunteers to read a text and to mark **scene boundaries that are indicated
by changes in narrative time and space.**

## Time changes

You may think of a time change as a disruption in the assumed,
smooth, linear progression of time - a tear, gap or other incongruity.  

Look for evocations of time that situate scenes or events 
at points or spans on the narrative timeline. A temporal marker may establish an absolute
or relative point in time ("May 5th," "a few days later"), symbolically 
position an event in time ("the first time X happened," "before X...now Y"), 
or circumscribe an event's duration. All markers may be precise or vague, and
operate on varying levels of time granularity, from seconds to decades. 

Note that not all time changes correspond to a change in scene. You 
must distinguish between when time is used to mark a scene change, and
when it indicates something else.

**Example 1**

"But I have studied the place for myself," continued Mr. Enfield.
"It seems scarcely a house. There is no other door, and nobody goes
in or out of that one but, once in a great while, the gentleman of
my adventure. There are three windows looking on the court on the
first floor; none below; the windows are always shut but they're
clean. And then there is a chimney which is generally smoking; so
somebody must live there. And yet it's not so sure; for the
buildings are so packed together about that court, that it's hard to
say where one ends and another begins."


*The pair walked on again for a while in silence;* and then,
"Enfield," said Mr. Utterson, "that's a good rule of yours."

Explanation: The passage of time is evoked, but it only serves to
indicate that both characters were lost in thought. After the temporal
signal, the two are still walking along the same path, 
engaged in the same conversation. No scene change has occurred. 

## Space changes

While spaces in a novel can be hierarchically organized by relations of 
containment (with rooms or streets always occurring within more
general settings such as houses or cities), we are interested in the *specific
and dynamic* over the general and static. Pay attention to the constantly shifting 
spatial frames that capture the immediate surroundings of events - the 
props and backdrops that potentiate characters' thoughts and actions 
from scene to scene. 

Strong indicators of significant spatial change may include partitions and pathways 
between spaces (walls, hallways, doors, windows), and actions of crossing 
thresholds.

A change in space may be abrupt (cinematically speaking, when a shot "cuts"
to a new setting). Or it may be continuous, simulating embodied travel (camera follows 
character from kitchen to backyard).

Changes in space may occur when narrative perspective jumps from one character
to another, depending on the surroundings of each character.  

Not all changes in space correspond to a change in scene. 

## Suspending narrative, breaching narrative levels

When a character narrates an eventful story situated in another time/space, 
breaching narrative levels, consider the boundary as a change in time/space. 
What if the thing we jump to is not eventful?
When a narrator suspends the event-story to make room for static descriptions
or summary, this may be a significant disruption in time/space. 

If we are immersively transported to another time/space, it is a scene 
change (even if just static description); if another time/space is merely mentioned, it is probably not. 


## Markers 
- To mark a change in time, use the symbol #. 
- To mark a change in space, use the symbol $.
- To mark a simultaneous change in time and space, use either #$ or $#.

Markers should only be placed between two sentences. Insert a marker between sentences A and B if sentence B begins in a new temporal or spatial location from sentence A. In some cases, the sentence boundary conceals an implicit "jump" from one location to the next. In other cases, sentence A may function as a fluid transition out of the previous location, and B may be a transition into the new one.

We would like you to trust your gut when identifying significant changes in time and space. However, when you encounter a highly ambiguous situation or one that is not covered in this document, note your uncertainty by appending a question mark to the usual symbol (#?, $?, #$?, $#?). 

## Examples

(1) "No; you are less than a servant, for you do nothing for your keep. There, sit down, and think over your wickedness." **$** They had got me by this time into the apartment indicated by Mrs. Reed, and had thrust me upon a stool: my impulse was to rise from it like a spring; their two pair of hands arrested me instantly.

(2) I had put on some clothes, though horror shook all my limbs; I issued from my apartment. **$** The sleepers were all aroused: ejaculations, terrified murmurs sounded in every room; door after door unclosed; one looked out and another looked out; the gallery filled.  Gentlemen and ladies alike had quitted their beds; and “Oh! what is it?”—“Who is hurt?”—“What has happened?”—“Fetch a light!”—“Is it fire?”—“Are there robbers?”—“Where shall we run?” was demanded confusedly on all hands.

(3) A long grace was said and a hymn sung; then a servant brought in some tea for the teachers, and the meal began. **#** Ravenous, and now very faint, I devoured a spoonful or two of my portion without thinking of its taste.

(4) October, November, December passed away. **#** One afternoon in January, Mrs. Fairfax had begged a holiday for Adèle, because she had a cold; and, as Adèle seconded the request with an ardour that reminded me how precious occasional holidays had been to me in my own childhood, I accorded it, deeming that I did well in showing pliability on the point.

(5)  It was evident, indeed, that she wished me to drop the subject, which I did accordingly. **#** For several subsequent days I saw little of Mr. Rochester. In the mornings he seemed much engaged with business, and, in the afternoon, gentlemen from Millcote or the neighbourhood called, and sometimes stayed to dine with him.  When his sprain was well enough to admit of horse exercise, he rode out a good deal; probably to return these visits, as he generally did not come back till late at night. During this interval, even Adèle was seldom sent for to his presence, and all my acquaintance with him was confined to an occasional rencontre in the hall, on the stairs, or in the gallery, when he would sometimes pass me haughtily and coldly, just acknowledging my presence by a distant nod or a cool glance, and sometimes bow and smile with gentlemanlike affability.
