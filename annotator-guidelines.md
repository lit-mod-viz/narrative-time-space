# Narrative Space/Time Expert Annotator Guidelines

## Goal

We would like to train a machine to discern boundaries between scenes in novels.
Here, scenes are defined as discrete units of narrative time and space. To 
provide the machine with instructive examples, we are asking a dozen or so 
human volunteers to read a text and to mark **intuitive boundaries that
signify changes in narrative time and space**.

## What do we mean by *narrative* time and space?

Narrative timeline differs from that of the reader. A few minutes in the
reader's world may constitute decades in the fictional one. To complicate
matters, fictional stories often contain multiple layers of narrative---worlds
within worlds---which unfold simultaneously in multiple dimensions. The same
goes for space. For example, a novel's protagonist may understand the story
from a different vantage point than that of the narrator.

Yet in another sense, readers proceed linearly, from left to right, out of the
past and into the future. From their point of view, time and space unfold
smoothly, without interruption.

Not all changes in time or space are significant. The action of somebody
standing up or moving to the corner of a room may indicate a new scene but it
may not. "A few seconds after" could mean a lot or nothing at all. In such
cases we ask you to rely on your natural, expert intuitions about time, space,
and scene formation. Don't think too hard about it. If you think there was a
scene change: if time or space was disrupted in some way, mark it as such.

Another way to approach the task would be to think climatically: were you to
write a film adaptation of the story, where would you place the scene markers.
Trust your intuition and try to be consistent throughout.

## Time changes

If we think of narrative time as a kind of a string, disruptions of narrative
would indicate tears or gaps in the natural, linear, smooth progression.

Perceptible time changes (those that break the continuity of the story.

We are looking for explicit temporal markers that situate events or scenes 
at points on the narrative timeline. A marker may establish an absolute
or relative point in time ("May 5th," "a few days later"), symbolically 
position an event in time ("the first time X happened," "before X...now Y"), 
or circumscribe an event's duration. All markers may be precise or vague, and
operate on varying levels of time granularity. 

Time changes are straightforward to note when events occur within the same 
narrative level. What if narrative levels are breached? 

 
What is major? Differentiate between mere reference to another time, and
immersive transportation to another time (latter is major). Thinking about
chronotope â in addition to explicit demarcation of time, does time
âthicken â take on flesh â become artistically
visibleâ? How situated is the reader in this new time, can she/he
construct mental representation of it?
How to deal with dual events (âmeanwhileâ)? If concurrent
event is in another place, just count this as a spatial change
How to handle embedded narratives? Breaching of narrative levels counts as
disruption in time if it is âmajorâ (see above)
Easier case: character tells eventful story situated in another time/another
place.
What if thing we jump to is not âeventfulâ? Example,
pauses/suspensions in which the event-story is interrupted to make room for
static descriptions or summary. YES â this counts as a time
disruption, even if we return to the same time as before 
Does not count â description is akin to âtaking inâ
the spatiotemporal moment (e.g. describing setup of party and the people we
see upon entering the party)

## Space changes

While spaces in a novel can be hierarchically organized by relations of 
containment (town > house > bedroom), we are interested in the *specific
and dynamic* over the general and static. Pay attention to the constantly shifting 
spatial frames that capture the immediate surroundings of events - the 
props and backdrops that potentiate characters' thoughts and actions 
from scene to scene.

Strong indicators of significant spatial change may include partitions and pathways 
between spaces (walls, hallways, doors, windows), and actions of crossing 
thresholds.

A change in space may be abrupt (cinematically speaking, when a shot "cuts"
to a new setting). It may be continuous, simulating embodied travel (camera follows 
character from kitchen to backyard).

Changes in space may occur when narrative perspective jumps from one character
to another, depending on the surroundings of each character.  

## Markers 
- To mark a change in time, use the symbol \*. 
- To mark a change in space, use the symbol $.
- To mark a simultaneous change in time and space, use either \*$ or $\*.

Markers should only be placed between two sentences. Insert a marker between sentences A and B if an implicit jump to a new time/space occurs between A and B, or when A is a fluid transition between times/spaces. 

We would like you to trust your gut when identifying significant changes in time and space. However, when you encounter a highly ambiguous situation or one that is not covered in this document, note your uncertainty by appending a question mark to the usual symbol (\*?, $?, \*$?, $\*?).
