# Narrative Space/Time Expert Annotator Guidelines

## Goal

We would like to train a machine capable of discerning scenes, defined here as
discrete units of narrative time and space. To do that we are asking a dozen
or so human volunteers to read a text and to mark **intuitive boundaries that
signify changes in narrative time and space**.

## What do we mean by *narrative* time and space?

Narrative timeline differs from that of the reader. A few minutes in the
reader's world may constitute decades in the fictional one. To complicate
matters, fictional stories often contain multiple layers of narrative---worlds
within worlds---which unfold simultaneously in multiple dimensions. The same
goes for space. For example, a novel's protagonist may understand the story
from a different vantage point than that of the narrator.

Yet in another sense, readers proceed linearly, from left to right, out of the
past and into the future. From their point of view, time and space unfold
smoothly, without interruption.

```

When reading your assigned novel, we ask that you pay attention to
disruptions, changes, or incongruities in the fabric of fictional time and
space by marking boundaries. Thus, place a spatial mark when a character or a
group of characters pass from one room to another, from inside to outside,
from one section of something to another.

Place a temporal mark when things happen "several years later," when paragraph
or chapter boundaries conceal a shift "a jump" in time, as they do in a
flashback.

Place both marks when both time and place shift inconsiderably as it happens
when we switch from character to character, or from a character's to a
narrator's point of view.

```

Not all changes in time or space are significant. The action of somebody
standing up or moving to the corner of a room may indicate a new scene but it
may not. "A few seconds after" could mean a lot or nothing at all. In such
cases we ask you to rely on your natural, expert intuitions about time, space,
and scene formation. Don't think too hard about it. If you think there was a
scene change: if time or space was disrupted in some way, mark it as such.

Another way to approach the task would be to think climatically: were you to
write a film adaptation of the story, where would you place the scene markers.
Trust your intuition and try to be consistent throughout.

## Time examples

Time changes fall into several broad categories.

If we think of narrative time as a kind of a string, disruptions of narrative
would indicate tears or gaps in the natural, linear, smooth progression.

that break the continuity of the story.
An author may signal a disturbance in the

Time: major disruption in time, is explicitly evoked by a temporal marker 
Absolute (Christmas, May 5th)
Relative (5 years later)
Time period 
Duration 
What is major? Differentiate between mere reference to another time, and
immersive transportation to another time (latter is major). Thinking about
chronotope â in addition to explicit demarcation of time, does time
âthicken â take on flesh â become artistically
visibleâ? How situated is the reader in this new time, can she/he
construct mental representation of it?
How to deal with dual events (âmeanwhileâ)? If concurrent
event is in another place, just count this as a spatial change
How to handle embedded narratives? Breaching of narrative levels counts as
disruption in time if it is âmajorâ (see above)
Easier case: character tells eventful story situated in another time/another
place.
What if thing we jump to is not âeventfulâ? Example,
pauses/suspensions in which the event-story is interrupted to make room for
static descriptions or summary. YES â this counts as a time
disruption, even if we return to the same time as before 
Does not count â description is akin to âtaking inâ
the spatiotemporal moment (e.g. describing setup of party and the people we
see upon entering the party)

## Space examples

Spatial frames â immediate surroundings of actual events, relevant to
plot at this time, actions/thoughts of characters. Spaces hierarchically
organized by containment (town > house > bedroom) but in general we want to be
much âsmallerâ than stable environment in which the whole
novel takes place, for example London
Good indicator of spatial change: imagery of partitions between spaces (walls,
hallways, doors, windows), and action of crossing thresholds
Could either cut to new space (think film â cutting to new space) OR
have a continuous transition (camera follows character from kitchen to
backyard)
Perspective jumping b/w characters â spatial change if immediate
surroundings of characters are different, not spatial change if characters are
in the same space
