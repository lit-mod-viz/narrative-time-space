# Narrative Space/Time Expert Annotator Guidelines

## Goal

We would like to train a machine to discern boundaries between scenes in novels.
Here, scenes are defined as discrete units of narrative time and space. To 
provide the machine with instructive examples, we are asking a dozen or so 
human volunteers to read a text and to mark **intuitive boundaries that
signify changes in narrative time and space**.

## What do we mean by *narrative* time and space?

Readers proceed linearly, from left to right, out of the
past and into the future. In the reader's world, time and space unfold
smoothly, without disturbance.

Narrative time differs from that of the reader. A few minutes in the
reader's world may constitute decades in the fictional one, and events
may be presented out of order. To complicate
matters, fictional stories often contain multiple layers of narrative---worlds
within worlds---which unfold simultaneously in multiple dimensions. The same
goes for space. For example, a novel's protagonist may understand the story
from a different vantage point than that of the narrator.

Not all changes in time or space are significant. The action of somebody
standing up or moving to the corner of a room may indicate a new scene but it
may not. "A few seconds after" could mean a lot or nothing at all. In such
cases we ask you to rely on your natural, expert intuitions about time, space,
and scene formation. Does the change in time or space meaningfully set the stage 
for what happens next in the plot? Trust your gut, and try to be consistent 
throughout.

## Time changes

Time changes are perceptible disruptions in the continuous progression of time.

Look for explicit evocations of time that situate scenes or events 
at points or spans on the narrative timeline. A temporal marker may establish an absolute
or relative point in time ("May 5th," "a few days later"), symbolically 
position an event in time ("the first time X happened," "before X...now Y"), 
or circumscribe an event's duration. All markers may be precise or vague, and
operate on varying levels of time granularity, from seconds to decades. 

**Breaching narrative levels**

When such cues are employed to fix the chronology of events within the same 
narrative level, they 
Time changes are straightforward to note when events occur within the same 
narrative level. What if narrative levels are breached? 

 
What is major? Differentiate between mere reference to another time, and
immersive transportation to another time (latter is major). Thinking about
chronotope â in addition to explicit demarcation of time, does time
âthicken â take on flesh â become artistically
visibleâ? How situated is the reader in this new time, can she/he
construct mental representation of it?
How to deal with dual events (âmeanwhileâ)? If concurrent
event is in another place, just count this as a spatial change
How to handle embedded narratives? Breaching of narrative levels counts as
disruption in time if it is âmajorâ (see above)
Easier case: character tells eventful story situated in another time/another
place.
What if thing we jump to is not âeventfulâ? Example,
pauses/suspensions in which the event-story is interrupted to make room for
static descriptions or summary. YES â this counts as a time
disruption, even if we return to the same time as before 
Does not count â description is akin to âtaking inâ
the spatiotemporal moment (e.g. describing setup of party and the people we
see upon entering the party)

## Space changes

While spaces in a novel can be hierarchically organized by relations of 
containment (town > house > bedroom), we are interested in the *specific
and dynamic* over the general and static. Pay attention to the constantly shifting 
spatial frames that capture the immediate surroundings of events - the 
props and backdrops that potentiate characters' thoughts and actions 
from scene to scene.

Strong indicators of significant spatial change may include partitions and pathways 
between spaces (walls, hallways, doors, windows), and actions of crossing 
thresholds.

A change in space may be abrupt (cinematically speaking, when a shot "cuts"
to a new setting). It may be continuous, simulating embodied travel (camera follows 
character from kitchen to backyard).

Changes in space may occur when narrative perspective jumps from one character
to another, depending on the surroundings of each character.  

## Markers 
- To mark a change in time, use the symbol #. 
- To mark a change in space, use the symbol $.
- To mark a simultaneous change in time and space, use either #$ or $#.

Markers should only be placed between two sentences. Insert a marker between sentences A and B if sentence B begins in a new temporal or spatial location from sentence A. In some cases, the sentence boundary conceals an implicit "jump" from one location to the next. In other cases, sentence A may function as a fluid transition out of the previous location, and B may be a transition into the new one.

We would like you to trust your gut when identifying significant changes in time and space. However, when you encounter a highly ambiguous situation or one that is not covered in this document, note your uncertainty by appending a question mark to the usual symbol (#?, $?, #$?, $#?). 

## Examples

(1) "No; you are less than a servant, for you do nothing for your keep. There, sit down, and think over your wickedness." **$** They had got me by this time into the apartment indicated by Mrs. Reed, and had thrust me upon a stool: my impulse was to rise from it like a spring; their two pair of hands arrested me instantly.

(2) I had put on some clothes, though horror shook all my limbs; I issued from my apartment. **$** The sleepers were all aroused: ejaculations, terrified murmurs sounded in every room; door after door unclosed; one looked out and another looked out; the gallery filled.  Gentlemen and ladies alike had quitted their beds; and “Oh! what is it?”—“Who is hurt?”—“What has happened?”—“Fetch a light!”—“Is it fire?”—“Are there robbers?”—“Where shall we run?” was demanded confusedly on all hands.

(3) A long grace was said and a hymn sung; then a servant brought in some tea for the teachers, and the meal began. **#** Ravenous, and now very faint, I devoured a spoonful or two of my portion without thinking of its taste.

(4) October, November, December passed away. **#** One afternoon in January, Mrs. Fairfax had begged a holiday for Adèle, because she had a cold; and, as Adèle seconded the request with an ardour that reminded me how precious occasional holidays had been to me in my own childhood, I accorded it, deeming that I did well in showing pliability on the point.

(5)  It was evident, indeed, that she wished me to drop the subject, which I did accordingly. **#** For several subsequent days I saw little of Mr. Rochester. In the mornings he seemed much engaged with business, and, in the afternoon, gentlemen from Millcote or the neighbourhood called, and sometimes stayed to dine with him.  When his sprain was well enough to admit of horse exercise, he rode out a good deal; probably to return these visits, as he generally did not come back till late at night. During this interval, even Adèle was seldom sent for to his presence, and all my acquaintance with him was confined to an occasional rencontre in the hall, on the stairs, or in the gallery, when he would sometimes pass me haughtily and coldly, just acknowledging my presence by a distant nod or a cool glance, and sometimes bow and smile with gentlemanlike affability.
